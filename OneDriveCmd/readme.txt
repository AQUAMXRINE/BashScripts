Hi,

lmao u really thought there was a full readme file hahahaha...
Anyway just download the file and execute it by opening it in your terminal (depends on your distro i guess)
(you also may need to make it executable [chmod +x /path/to/file])

It's simply gonna sync your onedrive and a folder created in /home on your computer (so you need to configure onedrive package before ofc) with a logs function that can be VERY helpful sometimes

Thanks for downloading !
